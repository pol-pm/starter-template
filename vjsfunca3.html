  <h1>Vanilla JS Functions - Activity 3</h1>
  <p>Write a JavaScript function that takes a number as a parameter and check the number is prime or not.</p>
  <p><u>Note:</u></p>
  <p>Prime numbers are the numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1, in other words, if we try to divide them
    by another number, the result is not a whole number.</p>
  <p>So, if we divide the number by anything other than 1 or itself, we will get a remainder that is not zero.</p>
  <p>Negative numbers can not be prime.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      // program to check if a number is prime or not

      // take input from the user
      let askPrime = prompt("Enter a non-negative number: ");

      function fPrime(number) {
        let isPrime = true;
        // check if number is equal to 1
        if (number === 1) {
          return "1 is neither prime nor composite number.";
        }
        // check if number is greater than 1
        else if (number > 1) {

          // looping through 2 to number-1
          for (let i = 2; i < number; i++) {
            if (number % i == 0) {
              isPrime = false;
              break;
            }
          }

          if (isPrime) {
            return number + " is a prime number";
          } else {
            return number + " is a not prime number";
          }
        }
        // check if number is less than 1
        else {
          return "The number is not a prime number.";
        }
      }

      document.write(fPrime(askPrime));
    </script>.
