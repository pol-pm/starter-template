    <h1>Secret Number Guessing Game</h1>
    <p>Guess the secret number between 1 and 10. You have 3 attempts.</p>

    <!-- User input and buttons -->
    <div>
      Your guess: <input type="number" id="userGuess" min="1" max="10" />
      <button onclick="guessNumber()">Submit Guess</button>
      <button onclick="resetGame()">Reset Game</button>
      <!-- Display messages to the user (guidance, errors, success) -->
      <p id="message"></p>
    </div>

    <script>
      // Variables for storing secret number and attempts
      let secretNumber;
      let attempts;

      // Initialize game by setting secret number, resetting attempts, and clearing message
      function initGame() {
        secretNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
        attempts = 3;
        document.getElementById("message").innerHTML = "";
        document.getElementById("userGuess").value = "";
      }

      /*
      Limiting the secret number to a range of 1 to 10 while giving the user only three attempts makes the game challenging yet feasible.
      It offers:
      - Balance of difficulty and playability: With a range of 10 numbers, there are enough possible values to make the game challenging
      but not extremely difficult. The user has a fair chance of guessing the correct number within three attempts,
      especially with guidance on whether their guess is too high or too low.
      - Simple and engaging: A smaller range like 1 to 10 keeps the game simple and easy to understand for players,
      making it more accessible and enjoyable for a wide range of audiences, including younger players or those who are new to games.
      - Quick gameplay: Giving the user only three attempts encourages quick decision-making and promotes replayability
      when they want to try again after winning or losing. This makes it suitable as a casual, time-pass entertainment option.
