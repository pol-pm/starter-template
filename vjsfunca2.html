  <h1>Vanilla JS Functions - Activity 2</h1>
  <p>Write a JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number (a non-negative integer n ). The function
    accepts the number as an argument.</p>
  <p><u>Note:</u></p>
  <p>The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number and it is represented by n!</p>
  <p>For example, the factorial of 6! is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.</p>

  <p>The factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.</p>

  <p>
    <script>
      let ask_fact = prompt("Enter a non-negative number: ");

      function factorial(number) {
        if (number < 0) { return "The factorial is not defined for negative numbers" }
        else if (number == 0) { return "The factorial of " + number + " = 1" }
        else {
          let fact = 1;
          for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {
            fact *= i;
          }
          return "The factorial of " + number + " = " + fact;
        }
      }

      document.write(factorial(ask_fact));
    </script>.
